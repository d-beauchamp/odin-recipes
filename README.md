# odin-recipes

This is a practice project from the Odin Project Foundations curriculum. It's a simple recipes page containing some of my favorite foods/recipes. 

However, as I was mainly focusing on practicing fundamental HTML by using common elements and tags to create a basic site, I didn't fully flesh out each recipe's text.
